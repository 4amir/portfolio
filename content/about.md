Hello 👋, I’m Aamir (pronounced - AaaMehr).

Senior iOS Engineer with 12+ years of experience architecting and delivering high-performance, user-focused mobile applications at scale. Expert in Swift, SwiftUl, and UIKit, with a proven record of leading large-scale refactors, modernizing legacy codebases, and launching high-impact consumer apps. Adept at integrating modern architectures, optimizing release pipelines, and mentoring diverse engineering teams. 

I’m always chasing that Apple-style polish where the details quietly shine. When I’m not shipping features, I’m usually tinkering on side projects, cooking, or reorganizing my espresso setup like it’s part of the roadmap.
